## Welcome

This repository belongs to students embarking on IB Computer Science between 2021 and 2023. Welcome! This project will *grow* with you and you will find everything related to practical sessions here.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

- `src`: the folder to maintain source code
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `database`: the folder that stores data files
- `log`: the folder that contains log files to record exceptions and unwanted behaviour

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
