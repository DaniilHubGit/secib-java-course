This repository belongs to students embarking on IB Computer Science between 2021 and 2023. Welcome! This project will *grow* with you and you will find everything related to practical sessions here.

## Folder Structure

The repos contains the following folders:

- `.vscode`: the project configuration files
- `database`: the folder that stores data files
- `draw.io`: the folder that will contain editable UML files for OOP tasks
- `img`: the folder that will home image files and diagrams linked in the README files
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `log`: the folder that contains log files to record exceptions and unwanted behaviour
- `res`: the folder to hold resources used by the programs e.g. images
- `src`: the folder to maintain source code and lesson notes

## Dependency Management

In VSCode The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## How To Use This Repo

Although this project will become more complex over time, you should always be able to recreate the experience in chronological order by carefully navigating the `src` folder. If you are in year 12 then your lessons are under `lower` but if you are in year 13 then the lessons are under `upper`. For every lesson a folder will be created that will contain, at the very least:

1. One or more Java classes written during lessons.
2. README.md with lesson notes and explainers.

This repository should be a companion when working on your IA and studying for your exams.
