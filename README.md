## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code. This is not a normal project but a repository of all the code that is meant to be like a course.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

There are other folders which will store code that was written during lessons.

- `lower`: the folder containing code written in IB lower year
- `upper`: the folder containing code written in IB upper year

Any code we compile will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Why have both in one place?

To learn from each other. The upper form students may want to remember what it is like taking the first steps. And the lower students might want to see where they will lead to in the near future.
