# Year 12 2021 Programming Assignment

This piece of work will contribute towards your Mid-Year grade.

# A utility program to understand arrays

You will be writing a utility program for programmers! For easy testing you will provide a **Menu Driven Interface** for all of the functionality in the `ArrayHelper`.

You will also need to *add value* by providing one additional utility function of your own choice. It is important that you are able to justify why the method you chose is important. My suggestion is to pick a domain (math, game, data) of your interest (your own independent research is required, the IB book can be really helpful here).

## Why are arrays so important?

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost **every** program (we do not exceggerate). Reason being, they are often a base to implement many other data structures, such as Lists, Stacks and Queues. Arrays are so popular because they are efficient to use:
1. Arrays take advantage of the computer organization. The data structure conveniently gives programmers an *abstraction* of the computer's memory and secondary storage.
2. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for **array operations**.

## Why do we need to do this assignment?

Although arrays are used in so many cases, for some reason Java does not really provide many tools and methods out of the box like it does with String. Therefore, we would need to write even the most common functions so that we can *re-use them later* when we build more complex programs. Reason being, by the time we get to that stage we do not want to be burdened with the mundane stuff. We would want to have tools that at the ready so that we can focus on what is really important.
