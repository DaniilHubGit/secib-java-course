# Unified Modelling Language (UML)

UML stands for Unified Modelling Language and it provides a way to visualise programs that are object-oriented. 

If you ever find yourself in a team of developers who *all* know UML (good luck with that) then you can use this tool for technical discussions in order to achieve one or more of the following:

- Specification which identifies what is needed to meet business requirements.
- Standard visualization because it is very common to work with people with different backgrounds and nationalities so UML *should be* something everyone can get behind.
- Architecture or design. UML can quickly let you know whether an idea is elegant or not.
- Construction since every diagram should be easily translated into code with minimal effort, Junior Developers fresh out of university tend to like building code off a UML because they can focus on getting used to tech stacks and company norms rather than be pressured to impress. There are even tools that from a model you can create a schema for a database.
- Testing concepts and ideas.
- Documentation (this is kind of an old idea which I don't believe really applies nowadays because code is constantly evolving, maybe I am wrong though).  

UML is huge but only class diagrams (the boxes with different compartments e.g. the soldier exercise we did on miro) are within the scope of IB.

The most important aspect of UML is to describe how many classes and objects are working together to solve a real-world problem. This is especially important for your IA.
