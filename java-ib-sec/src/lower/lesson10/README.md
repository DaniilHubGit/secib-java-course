# Analysing the structure of our programs (so far)

Before deep-diving into Object-Oriented Programming we are going to have a last look at how we have shaped our programs so far. In the beginning, programming is very much about exploring *what*, today will be one of the few times we talk about *why* the programs look a certain way.

## Blocks of code

Programming is a discipline that requires the organization of thought (hence the general principles which need to be applied). A program is a product of our organised thoughts. When we organise our thoughts we categorise, group, remove distractions etc...

In Java, our organised thinking translates to *blocks of code*, a block is a grouping of two or more statements. The visual cue for the groupings are the curly brackets `{}` where each pair defines a logical grouping.

In Visual Studio Code, each block can be opened or closed kind of how you would treat a chest of drawers so that you can abstract out unncessary details if you want to focus on something in particular.

Our most complex program to date is probably `MathPal.java`, so I made a short video on how blocks can be treated in Visual Studio Code:

## Variable scope


## Critical skills

Before we move on make sure you know...

From now on, our programs are going to look extremely different!
