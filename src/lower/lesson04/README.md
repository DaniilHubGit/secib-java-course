## 1.7 Working with Strings in Java

We have got pretty comfortable with primitive data types like `int` and `boolean` and we have started meeting with really interesting *complex* data types. As a rule of thumb, complex types start with a capital letter while simple types start with a small letter. Hope you noticed!

We have already seen through `Scanner` that the creation of these data types require the `new` keyword. The `String` class is no exception... 

`String myName = new String("Erika Camilleri");`

Although, lucky for us, Java also accepts a shorter way of doing this:

`String myFavouriteColour = "blue";`

## A Challenge

At this stage we have covered the absolute basics of Java. After just 4 lessons you should feel empowered to write semi interesting programs that go through an entire process of:

1. Accepting user input.
2. Performing some arithmetic (process).
3. And then displaying a result to the user as feedback or output.

Practice coding as much as you can!
